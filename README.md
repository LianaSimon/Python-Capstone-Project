# EMPLOYEE DATA ANALYSIS OF ABC COMPANY USING PYTHON(PYTHON CAPSTONE PROJECT)


## üìã PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project involves analyzing employee data from ABC Company to uncover insights related to team distribution, job roles, salary expenditure, and more. The dataset comprises 458 records with 9 columns, and Python was used to preprocess the data, perform analysis, and visualize key trends.


## üîßA) PREPROCESSING

- Replaced the incorrect `Height` values (originally stored as datetime) with random integers between 150 and 180 cm.
- 
- Filled missing salary values with `0` for analysis purposes.
- 

#### ‚úÖ Preprocessing Step 1: Open Jupyter Notebook

If you're using:

Anaconda: Launch the Anaconda Navigator and click on "Jupyter Notebook"

VS Code: Open a .ipynb file using the Jupyter extension

Online tools: You can use Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook in Kaggle


#### ‚úÖ Preprocessing Step 2: Import Required Libraries

In the first cell of your notebook, run:

#### ‚úÖ Preprocessing Step 3: Load the Excel File

If the Excel file is on your computer, move it to the same folder as your notebook.

##### Output

üîç Check if the "Height" column looks like a date (e.g., 2023-02-06) ‚Äî that confirms it needs fixing.


#### ‚úÖ Preprocessing Step 4: Replace the "Height" Column with Random Numbers (150‚Äì180 cm)

##### Output

#### ‚úÖ Preprocessing Step 5: Save the Cleaned Data (Optional but Useful)

You can now use this file (cleaned_employee_data.csv) for all further analysis steps.


#### üßº Summary of Preprocessing

1. Loaded the Excel file

2. Replaced the "Height" column with valid random values

3. (Optional) Saved the cleaned file for reuse




## üìä B) Analysis Tasks Step-by-Step in Jupyter Notebook


2. **Position-wise Segregation**  
   - Analyzed the count of employees in each job position.
   - Represented through a bar chart.

3. **Age Group Distribution**  
   - Categorized employees into age groups.
   - Visualized using a bar chart.

4. **Salary Expenditure**  
   - Identified the team and position with the highest total salary.
   - Visualized with bar charts for both teams and positions.

5. **Correlation Analysis**  
   - Checked for correlation between age and salary.
   - Represented using a scatter plot and correlation matrix.


#### ‚úÖ Analysis Step 6: Import Visualization Libraries

Add this to a new cell:
